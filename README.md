# FLIGHT PRICE RPEDICTION USING ONLY LINEAR REGRESSION

#### I have applied numerous supervised machine learning concepts, including:
* EDA
* Feature Encoding
* Feature Scaling
* Linear, Lasso(L1) & Ridg(L2) Regression
* Kfold
* cross val
* Hyper Parameter Tuning
* GridSearchCV

As part of my practice, I have created this repository to showcase my knowledge of diverse concepts compiled into mini-projects.

This app is built using [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/).
